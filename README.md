# general information

This is the client side application for `YouCanBenefit`. It is designed such that a user can input certain demographic information 
-- such as income, age etc -- and the [backend](https://github.com/yeg-relief/api-server) will return a list of *potentially* 
elligible social benefits. 

There is also an administrator section that allows for privelleged users to modify the datastore. These modifications are such that 
new programs can be uploaded, queries (conditions on user demographics) to determine elligiblilty for said programs and 
the `Master Screener` or questionaire can be modified.
