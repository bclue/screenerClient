            <p>e4c is a non-profit, charitable organization that has been working for almost
                50 years to help vulnerable people here and now. At the same time, we’re working to
                prevent and eventually eliminate poverty. It’s a big task, but one we know is possible
                with the help of others who are ready to see the strength we see in the people we serve.
                Our organization’s areas of focus are shelter and housing, community and collaboration,
                skill development and education, and food security.

            <p>
                As the government closest to Canadians, municipalities touch almost every aspect of our citizens’ daily lives.
                We’re citizens too - 12,000 employees who provide services to our nearly 900,000 neighbours in the most open
                and responsive way we can.
                <br><br>
                The City of Edmonton doesn't do this alone. We’re part of a larger ecosystem of government, post-secondary institutions, the arts,
                not-for-profits, school boards, private business and citizens —  integral partners in an intelligent community.
                Embracing the perspectives from individuals, industry and academic sectors is how we can best achieve our goals,
                deliver programs and services and provide an exceptional quality of life for citizens.
